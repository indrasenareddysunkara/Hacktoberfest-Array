This is Catalog Challenge about solving polynomial using cryptography algorithm in which i used lagrange interpolation.
My approach is as follows
*Mainly it includes 3 sub functions 
1.Taking a json file as an input and parsing the input into the format which is suitable for further computation
2.It includes converting those base values into standard input format
3.Finding the secret(c) by applying lagranges interpolation
